    "## Why Tokenization Matters in LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models cannot process raw text directly. Neural networks operate on numbers, not words. Therefore, the first critical step is transforming text into numerical representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization converts raw text into discrete units (tokens), each mapped to a unique integer ID. This allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a fixed vocabulary\n",
    "- Represent text as sequences of integers\n",
    "- Feed those sequences into neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Without tokenization, there would be no structured way for the model to interpret language. In LLMs, tokenization defines the model’s “language interface” — it determines how text is broken down and how meaning is encoded at the most basic level."

    "## Why Sliding Windows Are Used\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained to predict the next token given previous tokens. To achieve this, we must convert long text into many smaller training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sliding window technique creates overlapping input-target pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:  [x1, x2, x3, x4]  \n",
    "Target: [x2, x3, x4, x5]\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the model to learn next-token prediction repeatedly across the entire text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overlap (controlled by stride) is important because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smaller stride → more training samples\n",
    "- Larger stride → fewer samples\n",
    "- Overlapping windows reuse context efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "This is crucial for training because it maximizes learning from limited text data."

    "## Why Do Embeddings Encode Meaning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings encode meaning because of how they are trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, tokens that appear in similar contexts receive similar gradient updates. Over time, this causes their vectors to move closer together in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is based on the Distributional Hypothesis:\n",
    "“Words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.”\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, words like \"king\" and \"queen\" or \"cat\" and \"dog\" often appear in related contexts. The neural network adjusts their vectors accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a neural network perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embeddings are trainable parameters\n",
    "- They are updated through backpropagation\n",
    "- They form the first layer of the model\n",
    "- They enable semantic structure to emerge in high-dimensional space\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning is not manually programmed — it emerges from optimization."

    "## What Is an Embedding Layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding layer is a trainable matrix that maps token IDs to dense vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, it is equivalent to multiplying a one-hot vector by a weight matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding Matrix Shape:\n",
    "[vocab_size × embedding_dim]\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row corresponds to one token in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of representing tokens as sparse one-hot vectors (mostly zeros), embeddings represent them as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. This reduces dimensionality and allows the model to learn relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding layer is not just a lookup table — it is a set of parameters updated through backpropagation during training."

    "## Experiment: Effect of max_length and Stride\n",
    "\n",
    "By modifying max_length and stride, we observe changes in the number of generated training samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "When stride = 1:\n",
    "- Windows overlap heavily\n",
    "- Many training samples are created\n",
    "- More efficient reuse of text\n",
    "\n",
    "When stride = max_length:\n",
    "- No overlap\n",
    "- Fewer training samples\n",
    "- Less contextual reuse\n",
    "\n",
    "Overlap is useful because it increases the effective dataset size without requiring more text. This improves generalization and allows the model to learn transitions between tokens more smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In large-scale LLM training, stride selection impacts both computational cost and data efficiency."
